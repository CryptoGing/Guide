## Pi’s Vision
Pi vision is to build the world’s most inclusive peer-to-peer ecosystem and online experience, fueled by Pi, the world’s most widely used cryptocurrency.

Pi delivers on the true promise of blockchain: a massive, accessible, and open community powered by the world’s most widely distributed cryptocurrency that enables a robust ecosystem for members, merchants and developers alike. Founded in 2018 by a team of early innovators in blockchain and social computing, with PhDs from Stanford University, Pi Network is a utilities-based ecosystem for third-party apps on a mobile web platform, with widespread (rather than concentrated) token distribution. The blockchain platform offers a mobile-first mining approach, with low financial cost and a light environmental footprint within the crypto space. The community boasts an engaged 35M+ members in over 230 countries or regions.


## Pi Mobile Apps
There are two apps that users are required to download in order to join the ecosystem.

The first is Pi App; this is Pi’s original mining app and the home of Pi’s unique mining mechanism. Downloading Pi App and creating an account allows anyone to participate in the ecosystem and mine Pi.

Pi App is available for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blockchainvault) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pi-network/id1445472541).

The second is the Pi Browser, which is the mobile web platform for the Pi ecosystem. This is the window through which Pioneers (users and members of the Pi community) experience community developers’ applications. There is a more detailed explanation on the Pi Browser within the “Getting Started” category.

Pi Browser is available for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pi.browser) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pi-browser/id1560911608).

Developers with Android phones that don't have access to the Google Play Store can instead use the APKs for [Pi App](https://minepi.com/android-apk) and [Pi Browser](http://cdn.minepi.com/browser/pi-browser.apk).

## Documentation

There are two approaches to onboarding.

The first option is to use this guide and move through its various categories. It will cover getting set up all the way through to processing payments. Head over to the <a href="../../gettingStarted">Getting Started</a> category and start with the Pi Browser Introduction.

If you are looking for a less structured process, the second option is to go to our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pi-apps/pi-platform-docs) and jump right into integrations. We advise against the second option because while it's straightforward to integrate, you will miss out on learning the unique benefits and features that Pi has for developers.

## Whitepaper
The [Original Pi Whitepaper](https://minepi.com/white-paper) was published on PiDay, March 14, 2019. While our original vision remains unchanged, the details of this whitepaper are not fully up to date. On December 28, 2021, along with the release of the Enclosed mainnet, we published three draft chapters of the [Updated Whitepaper](https://medium.com/@pinetwork-official/pi-whitepaper-chapters-mainnet-token-model-mining-and-roadmap-19f4a6774e71), detailing the Pi token token model and mining mechanism as well as the project’s roadmap.


## Developer Terms of Service
By accessing or using any part of the Pi Network Developer tools and resources, you agree that you are subject to and will comply with the [Pi Network Developer Terms of Use](https://socialchain.app/developer_terms).
