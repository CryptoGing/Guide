# Community Support
The fastest way to ask a question or get help is to join our Pi Ecosystem Discord Server. In this server you will find many other developers who are also building on Pi and can assist you with any questions. The Core Team is active in that server as well and can assist. 

You can also send a message within the chat feature that is in the Pi App. It can be accessed by clicking on the sidebar menu within the Pi App. One of our great Moderators will assist you.
