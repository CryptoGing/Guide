# Community Support
Pi community is one of its kind. Having mined the Pi cryptocurrency through various contributions to the network and witnessed its development from the beginning, Pioneers are excited to offer support to its new members and help grow the Pi ecosystem. 

## Discord
The fastest way to ask a question or get help is to join our Pi Ecosystem Discord server. Here, you will find many other developers who are also building on Pi and can assist you with any questions. The Core Team is active in that server as well and can assist.

## Pi App Chat
You can also send a message on the Developer chat room on the Pi App for help from other fellow Pi community developers or chat moderators. To subscribe to the Developer chat room, select the “Chat” icon from the home screen of the Pi app (or the “chat.pi” tile on the Pi Browser’s welcome page) and then select the ➕ near the bottom right of the screen to find a list of the other chat rooms. From this list, you can subscribe to the Developer chat room by selecting the corresponding green “+” icon. Once you subscribe to it, that chat room will now be shown in your regular list of chat rooms.

## Twitter
Pi app’s home screen offers regular network updates, including any tech or ecosystem-related updates. Some of these updates are published on the [Website](https://minepi.com/blog) blog as well. You can also follow us on  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PiCoreTeam) for announcements.
