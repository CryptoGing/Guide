# Pi Demo App Frontend 


Pi Demo App is an example React app created with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

## Setup

In order to start the app install dependencies

#### `npm install` or `yarn install`

<br/> 

and then run the app in development mode:

#### `npm start` or `yarn start`

## Running app in the Sandbox

To test all of the Demo App features, you need to open it in the Sandbox by pasting the correct Sandbox URL into your browser. Perform either one of the following:

<br/>

1. Use provided demo-app URL: https://sandbox.minepi.com/mobile-app-ui/app/demo-app-2

    - This Sandbox URL is listening for the frontend app running on port 3000

<br/>

2. Register a new app using Developer Portal and use your own Sandbox URL. 

    - For guidelines on how to register an app and get the Sandbox URL, please refer to [Developer Portal - Register an App](../../gettingStarted/devPortal/#registering-an-app)

    - **Note:** Make sure to run the app on the same port that you registered it with on the Developer Portal. By default, the app will run on port 3000. If you need, you can change the port by specifying it in `.env` file
