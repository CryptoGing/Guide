## Pi Payments

This section covers all the relevant topics on creating, receiving, and sending payments of various types utilizing the Pi SDK. Pioneers utilize the Pi Wallet within Pi Browser and all documentation is related to the functionality associated with the Pi Wallet. Currently, Pioneer-to-App is the only payment method supported by the Pi SDK. Coming soon will be App-to-Pioneer payments and Pioneer-to-Pioneer payments initiated by an App.
