<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it</h2>

<p>The app is where you register as a developer and get developer credentials to create third-party Pi Apps ‚Äì web-apps that can be accessed through the Pi Browser.  By declaring your app‚Äôs URL here, your app will be able to access the Pi APIs and communicate with the Pi servers and the Pi Blockchain.</p>

<p>Your app will be accessible directly from your own URL through the Pi Browser. You can put your app on any domain you want and still have a fully functional Pi app.</p>

<p>To access this feature either head to develop.pi or open the Pi Browser and click on the develop tile.</p>

<p>Currently, all APIs are aimed the Pi Testnet, so only Test-Pi will be involved. This will allow developers to build apps ahead of the release of the Mainnet SDK. Check out the section <a href="/docs/importantTopics/mainnetVsTestnet/#mainnetVsTestnet">Mainnet vs Testnet</a></p>

<p>The only requirement at this stage is that you own the domain of the URL that you provide! You will be asked to verify its ownership.</p>

<p>With the Pi SDK comes the Pi API, where you can execute HTTP requests against the main Pi Backend. For now this is only meant to handle payments but more abilities will be added in the future, like creating chat conversations on the Pi Chat from your application. At the bottom of the page, you can see a section called ‚ÄúAPI Keys‚Äù. You will need it to access the PI Backend as an application developer. Keep it safe! Anyone with this key can pretend to be you.</p>

<p>Note that accessing the public Pi blockchain does not require any API keys, you can simply produce transactions using your App‚Äôs private key and submit them directly to the blockchain through any public node (e.g. your own node, one of Pi Core Team‚Äôs nodes, or any other node that is running the ‚ÄúBlockchain API service‚Äù)</p>
