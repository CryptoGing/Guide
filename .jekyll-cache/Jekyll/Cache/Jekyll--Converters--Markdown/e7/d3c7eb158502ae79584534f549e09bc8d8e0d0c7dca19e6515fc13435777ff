<p>The app is where you register as a developer and get developer credentials to create third-party Pi Apps â€“ web-apps that can be accessed through the Pi Browser.  By declaring your appâ€™s URL here, your app will be able to access the Pi APIs and communicate with the Pi servers and the Pi Blockchain.</p>

<p>Your app will be accessible directly from your own URL through the Pi Browser. You can put your app on any domain you want and still have a fully functional Pi app.</p>

<p>To access this feature either head to develop.pi or open the Pi Browser and click on the develop tile.</p>

<p>Currently, all APIs are aimed the Pi Testnet, so only Test-Pi will be involved. This will allow developers to build apps ahead of the release of the Mainnet SDK. Check out the section <a href="/docs/importantTopics/mainnetVsTestnet/#mainnetVsTestnet">Mainnet vs Testnet</a></p>

<p>The only requirement at this stage is that you own the domain of the URL that you provide! You will be asked to verify its ownership.</p>
