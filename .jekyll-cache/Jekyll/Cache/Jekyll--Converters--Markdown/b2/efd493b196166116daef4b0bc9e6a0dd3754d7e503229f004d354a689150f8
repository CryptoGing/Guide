<p class="fs-6 fw-300">Welcome to Pi’s home of documentation for new developers. We are excited that you are interested in joining our Ecosystem. This guide is intended to introduce you to all the topics relevant to getting started with building on Pi.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="pis-vision">Pi’s Vision</h2>
<p>Pi vision is to build the world’s most inclusive peer-to-peer ecosystem and online experience, fueled by Pi, the world’s most widely used cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Pi delivers on the true promise of blockchain: a massive, open community powered by the world’s most widely distributed cryptocurrency that delivers accessibility and enables a robust ecosystem for members, merchants and developers alike. Founded in 2018 by a team of early innovators in blockchain and social computing, with PhDs from Stanford University, Pi Network is a utilities-based ecosystem for third-party apps on a mobile web platform, with widespread (rather than concentrated) token distribution. The blockchain platform offers a mobile-first mining approach, with low financial cost and a light environmental footprint within the crypto space.  The community boasts an engaged 35M+ members in over 230 countries or regions.</p>

<h2 id="pi-mobile-apps">Pi Mobile Apps</h2>
<p>There are two apps which are required to join the ecosystem.</p>

<p>The first is Pi’s original Mining App and it is home to the unique mining mechanism of Pi. Downloading and creating an account allows anyone to participate in the ecosystem and mine Pi.</p>

<p>Pi App is available for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blockchainvault">Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pi-network/id1445472541">iOS</a>.</p>

<p>The second is the Pi Browser, which is the mobile web platform for the Pi ecosystem – the window through which Pioneers (users and members of the Pi community) experience community developers applications. There is a more detailed explanation on the Pi Browser within the “Getting Started” category.</p>

<p>Pi Browser is available for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pi.browser">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pi-browser/id1560911608">iOS</a>.</p>

<p>Developers with Android phones that don’t have access to the Google Play Store can instead use the APKs for <a href="http://cdn.minepi.com/browser/pi-browser.apk">Pi App</a> and <a href="http://cdn.minepi.com/browser/pi-browser.apk">Pi Browser</a>.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>There are two approaches to onboarding.</p>

<p>First is to use this guide and move through its various categories. It will cover getting set up all the way through to processing payments. Head over to the <a href="../../gettingStarted">Getting Started</a> category and start with the Pi Browser Introduction.</p>

<p>Or if you are looking for a less structured process you can go to our <a href="https://github.com/pi-apps/pi-platform-docs">GitHub Repository</a> and jump right into integrations. We advise against the second option because while it’s straightforward to integrate, you will miss out on learning the unique benefits and features that Pi has for developers.</p>

<h2 id="whitepaper">Whitepaper</h2>
<p>We are currently updating the <a href="https://minepi.com/white-paper">Original Pi Whitepaper</a> to match the current state of the project. While our original vision remains unchanged, we have made large strides in the years since starting. The first released chapters of the <a href="https://medium.com/@pinetwork-official/pi-whitepaper-chapters-mainnet-token-model-mining-and-roadmap-19f4a6774e71">Updated Whitepaper</a> detail the token supply and mining mechanism as well as the project’s roadmap.</p>

<h2 id="developer-terms-of-service">Developer Terms of Service</h2>
<p>By accessing or using any part of the Pi Network Developer tools and resources, you agree that you are subject to and will comply with the <a href="https://socialchain.app/developer_terms">Pi Network Developer Terms of Use</a>.</p>
